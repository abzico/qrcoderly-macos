# qrcoderly-macos

This is a menubar macOS app to read QRCode image.

If supports reading URL and text content. If it's URL, then it will open native web browser, otherwise it will show text result.

QRCode image to feed to this app can be in general. But we aim to use it with [qrcodify-ios](https://github.com/abzico/qrcodify-ios)
